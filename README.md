# 🛒 🥕 Instacart Customer Analysis

## 🍏 Introduction
Instacart is an American technology company that operates as a same-day grocery delivery and pick up service in the U.S. and Canada. Customers shop for groceries through the Instacart mobile app or Instacart.com from various retailer partners. The order is shopped and delivered by an Instacart personal shopper.

### 🍞 Objective
The project aims to analyze grocery order data from Instacart, to investigate customer churn by identifying reasons for discontinuation and calculating the churn rate for the past quarter. It will also involve predicting future churn percentages and developing retention strategies, along with building a machine learning model to forecast which products customers are likely to purchase in their next order.
